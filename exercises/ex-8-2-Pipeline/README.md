# Exercise - Support Vector Machines Pipeline

##Instructions:

###1. Load Trained SVM Model
Copy the pickle files 1) model file `model_svm.p` and 2) normalization parameters `svm_params.p` into the working directory.

###2. Sign Detection Pipeline
Run `pipeline.py` to process a single video avi file (`testmode='video'`) or a directory of captured camera image frames (`testmode='images'`)
Note: edit input paths in line 27 for video and line 25 for images
